# Problem Statement
One of the staples of college life is the dining courts, yet choosing a dining court remains a hard decision. Existing platforms include Purdueâ€™s official dining app, which provides basic menu items and nutritional information, and review platforms such as Google Maps and Yelp, which are unintegrated into the dining court system, meaning they do not provide a rating for each dish. CourtSort seeks to enhance the dining court experience by providing real-time dish ratings, intelligently predicting what dining court is best suited for your social circles, and allowing users to report equipment malfunctions, long lines, and lack of available seating. Ultimately, by collecting information from each user we aim to create a smarter dining court application that learns from the user and provides suggestions that make for a happier Boilermaker.

# Project Objectives
* Recommend a dining court based on user profiles, crowdsourced information, and friend locations.
* Create user profiles with personal information such as preferences, dietary restrictions, and daily eating habits.
* Create a public forum for dining court ratings, warnings, and dish feedback. 
* A friend connection system which allows you to connect with friends to match dining court choices according to personal and group preferences.
* The ability to browse ratings and reviews of specific dishes offered at dining courts to make choices on what to eat for any given meal.
* Incorporate already popular features such as browsing daily menus of the dining courts
